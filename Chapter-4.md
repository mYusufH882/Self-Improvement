_Pecah Masalah Jadi Bagian Kecil. Prioritaskan Penyebab. Gunakan 'Jika-Maka' untuk Menemukan Solusi_

---

## üéØ **PENGANTAR BAB 4**

Setelah menguasai logika dasar (Bab 1), mental arithmetic (Bab 2), dan reasoning kompleks (Bab 3), sekarang saatnya mengintegrasikan semua skills untuk menyelesaikan masalah real-world secara sistematis.

**Core Principles dari file asli:**

- **Pecah masalah jadi bagian kecil** ‚Üí Decomposition strategy
- **Prioritaskan penyebab** ‚Üí Root cause analysis & prioritization matrix
- **Gunakan 'jika-maka'** ‚Üí Conditional logic trees untuk solution finding

**Why This Framework Matters:**
Dalam kehidupan nyata, masalah jarang datang dalam bentuk yang jelas dan terstruktur. Framework sistematis membantu:

- **Clarity in chaos** - struktur untuk masalah yang ambiguous
- **Efficient resource allocation** - fokus di high-impact solutions
- **Reduced cognitive load** - systematic approach mengurangi mental fatigue
- **Repeatable success** - framework bisa diaplikasikan ke berbagai domain

5. Password hashing (3 sec)
6. Send confirmation email (8 sec) ‚Üê BOTTLENECK
7. Database insert (2 sec)
8. Return success (1 sec)

Total: 52 seconds (bottlenecks account for 25%)
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Enhanced 5 Whys Method**

```
PROBLEM: Customer support response time increased from 2 hours to 12 hours

WHY 1: Why did response time increase?
‚Üí Support team is overwhelmed with ticket volume

    EVIDENCE: Ticket queue length increased 300%
    VERIFY: Check ticket metrics ‚úì

WHY 2: Why is ticket volume so high?
‚Üí New product feature causing confusion + existing issues not resolved

    EVIDENCE: 60% of tickets about new feature, 40% repeat issues
    VERIFY: Analyze ticket categories ‚úì

WHY 3: Why is new feature causing confusion?
‚Üí Documentation is unclear and no user training provided

    EVIDENCE: Documentation scores 2.1/5, no training materials exist
    VERIFY: User feedback surveys ‚úì

WHY 4: Why was documentation unclear?
‚Üí Feature rushed to market, documentation written by developers, not tech writers

    EVIDENCE: Project timeline shortened 3 weeks, no tech writer assigned
    VERIFY: Project timeline analysis ‚úì

WHY 5: Why was feature rushed?
‚Üí Competitive pressure, CEO mandated early launch

    EVIDENCE: Competitor launched similar feature 2 months ago
    VERIFY: Market analysis ‚úì

ROOT CAUSE: Process gap - no mandatory documentation review before feature launch
SYSTEMIC CAUSE: Competitive pressure overriding quality processes

```

#### **Brainstorming with Constraints**

```
CREATIVE CONSTRAINTS METHOD:
"How might we solve X, if we could only use Y?"

EXAMPLES:
- How might we improve checkout speed, if we could only change frontend?
- How might we reduce support tickets, if we had zero budget?
- How might we increase sales, if we couldn't change prices?
- How might we improve UX, if users could only use keyboard?

CONSTRAINT REMOVAL:
"What would we do if constraint X didn't exist?"
Then work backwards to find ways to remove or minimize the constraint.
```

### **Solution Evaluation Framework**

#### **Decision Matrix**

```
CRITERIA (with weights):
Cost (25%): How expensive to implement?
Time (20%): How long to implement?
Risk (15%): What could go wrong?
Impact (25%): How much improvement expected?
Maintainability (15%): How easy to maintain?

SOLUTIONS COMPARISON:
                    Cost  Time  Risk  Impact  Maintain  Weighted
Solution A (CDN)      8     9     7      6        8       7.4
Solution B (Cache)    9     8     8      7        7       7.7
Solution C (Rewrite)  3     2     4      9        5       5.5

Ranking: Solution B > Solution A > Solution C
```

#### **Risk Assessment Matrix**

```
For each solution, evaluate:

PROBABILITY √ó IMPACT = RISK SCORE

Low Risk (1-4): Green light
Medium Risk (5-15): Proceed with mitigation
High Risk (16-25): Requires approval
Critical Risk (>25): Avoid or extensively mitigate

EXAMPLE - Database Optimization:
Technical Risk: 3 √ó 3 = 9 (Medium)
Schedule Risk: 2 √ó 4 = 8 (Medium)
Cost Risk: 1 √ó 3 = 3 (Low)
Business Risk: 1 √ó 5 = 5 (Medium)

Overall: Medium risk, proceed with monitoring

## üéØ **REAL-WORLD CASE STUDIES**

### **Case Study 1: Coding Error Investigation**

#### **Problem Statement**

```
SITUATION:
Production API started returning 500 errors for 15% of requests
Started 3 hours ago, affecting customer payments
Revenue impact: $2,000/hour in lost transactions

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Rolled back last deployment (didn't fix)
- Checked server resources (CPU/Memory normal)
- Verified database connectivity (working)
```

#### **Systematic Analysis**

```
PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND
WHO: All customers using payment API
WHAT: 15% of payment requests fail with 500 error
WHERE: Production environment only
WHEN: Started 3 hours ago, no clear pattern
WHY: Revenue loss, customer satisfaction impact
HOW: API returns "Internal Server Error"

CONSTRAINTS:
- Cannot take payment system offline
- Must fix within 2 hours (business critical)
- Limited debugging in production

PHASE 2: DECOMPOSE
Payment API Flow:
1. Request validation ‚Üí No errors in logs
2. User authentication ‚Üí Working normally
3. Payment processing ‚Üí Some failures here
4. Database transaction ‚Üí Partial failures
5. External payment gateway ‚Üí Normal response times
6. Response formatting ‚Üí No issues

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
WHY 1: Why are 15% of payment requests failing?
‚Üí Database transaction timeouts

WHY 2: Why are database transactions timing out?
‚Üí Lock contention on payment_transactions table

WHY 3: Why is there lock contention?
‚Üí Long-running cleanup job started 3 hours ago

WHY 4: Why is cleanup job causing locks?
‚Üí Job processes millions of old records without batching

WHY 5: Why wasn't this caught in testing?
‚Üí Cleanup job only runs in production, test data too small

ROOT CAUSE: Unbatched cleanup job causing database locks
```

#### **Solution Implementation**

```
PHASE 3: SOLUTIONS

IF-THEN DECISION TREE:
IF cleanup job is still running THEN
    Kill the job immediately
    Implement batched processing
ELSE IF locks still exist THEN
    Kill blocking transactions
    Restart database if necessary
ELSE
    Monitor for recurrence

IMMEDIATE ACTION (5 minutes):
- Kill long-running cleanup job
- Clear any remaining locks
- Verify payment API recovery

SHORT-TERM FIX (2 hours):
- Rewrite cleanup job with batching (1000 records at a time)
- Add progress monitoring
- Test on staging environment

LONG-TERM PREVENTION (1 week):
- Implement job queue system
- Add production job monitoring
- Create staging environment with production-size data
- Establish database maintenance windows

PHASE 4: MONITOR
- Payment success rate back to 99.8% within 10 minutes
- Set up alerts for database lock contention
- Schedule weekly review of long-running jobs
```

Scenario B (Two-tier):
Basic tier projection:
- 40% of current customers ‚Üí 400 √ó $30 = $12,000
- 60% conversion to premium ‚Üí 600 √ó $80 = $48,000
- New customer increase 80% ‚Üí 90/month
- Basic attracts 60, Premium attracts 30
- Monthly revenue: $12,000 + $48,000 + (60√ó$30) + (30√ó$80) = $65,200

Scenario C (Freemium):
- Higher acquisition but lower conversion
- More complex to execute
- Higher support costs

## üöÄ **KEY TAKEAWAYS BAB 4**

### **Universal Problem-Solving Principles:**

```
1. UNDERSTAND FIRST: Don't rush to solutions
   - 25% of time spent understanding saves 75% later
   - Clear problem definition prevents scope creep
   - Constraints shape viable solutions

2. DECOMPOSE SYSTEMATICALLY: Break complex into simple
   - Hierarchical breakdown reveals hidden issues
   - Process mapping shows bottlenecks
   - Root cause analysis prevents symptom fixing

3. PRIORITIZE RUTHLESSLY: Not all problems are equal
   - Impact vs Effort matrix guides resource allocation
   - MoSCoW method clarifies what's essential
   - Business value drives technical decisions

4. THINK IN CONDITIONALS: Prepare for multiple scenarios
   - If-then trees handle complexity
   - Decision matrices compare options objectively
   - Risk assessment prevents costly mistakes

5. MONITOR AND ADAPT: Solutions evolve
   - Leading indicators predict problems
   - Feedback loops enable course correction
   - Continuous improvement prevents stagnation
```

### **When to Use Each Technique:**

#### **5W+1H Analysis - Use When:**

```
‚úÖ Problem is ambiguous or poorly defined
‚úÖ Multiple stakeholders with different perspectives
‚úÖ Need to establish scope and boundaries
‚úÖ Starting a new project or investigation
```

#### **If-Then Decision Trees - Use When:**

```
‚úÖ Multiple decision points in a process
‚úÖ Need consistent decision-making across team
‚úÖ Complex logic with many variables
‚úÖ Automating decision processes
```

#### **Root Cause Analysis - Use When:**

```
‚úÖ Recurring problems that need permanent fixes
‚úÖ Systemic issues affecting multiple areas
‚úÖ High-impact problems worth deep investigation
‚úÖ Need to prevent future occurrences
```

#### **Prioritization Matrix - Use When:**

```
‚úÖ Limited resources (time, money, people)
‚úÖ Multiple competing priorities
‚úÖ Need objective criteria for decisions
‚úÖ Stakeholder alignment required
```

### **Common Problem-Solving Mistakes:**

```
‚ùå JUMPING TO SOLUTIONS: Skipping the understanding phase
‚Üí ‚úÖ Spend adequate time defining the problem clearly

‚ùå SOLVING SYMPTOMS: Addressing effects instead of causes
‚Üí ‚úÖ Use root cause analysis to find true issues

‚ùå PERFECTIONISM: Over-analyzing instead of acting
‚Üí ‚úÖ Balance analysis with timely action

‚ùå SINGLE SOLUTION THINKING: Only considering one approach
‚Üí ‚úÖ Generate multiple options before choosing

‚ùå IGNORING CONSTRAINTS: Proposing unrealistic solutions
‚Üí ‚úÖ Always consider time, budget, and resource limits

‚ùå NO MONITORING: Assuming solutions work as planned
‚Üí ‚úÖ Build in feedback mechanisms and success metrics
```

### **Real-World Application Framework:**

```
DAILY DECISIONS (5-10 minutes):
- What's the real problem here?
- What are my constraints?
- What are 2-3 possible approaches?
- What would success look like?

WEEKLY CHALLENGES (30-60 minutes):
- Full 5W+1H analysis
- Generate multiple solutions
- Use decision matrix for selection
- Create basic implementation plan

MAJOR PROJECTS (Multiple sessions):
- Comprehensive stakeholder analysis
- Detailed decomposition and root cause analysis
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Phased implementation with monitoring
```
