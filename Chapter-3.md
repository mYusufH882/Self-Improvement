## 🧩 **MULTI-STEP DEDUCTIVE REASONING**

### **The Chain Reasoning Method**

```
Premise 1 → Intermediate Conclusion → Premise 2 → Final Conclusion

Example:
Step 1: If server overloaded → response time slow
Step 2: If response time slow → users complain
Step 3: If users complain → revenue drops
Chain: Server overloaded → Revenue drops
```

### **Advanced Syllogistic Chains**

#### **Three-Step Reasoning Example:**

```
Problem: Determine who gets promoted

Given:
1. All team leads get promoted OR have 5+ years experience
2. Sarah is team lead
3. Sarah doesn't have 5+ years experience
4. Only people who get promoted receive stock options
5. Sarah received stock options

Question: Is this scenario consistent?

Solution:
Step 1: From (2) and (1): Sarah gets promoted OR has 5+ years
Step 2: From (3): Sarah doesn't have 5+ years
Step 3: From Step 1 & 2: Sarah must get promoted
Step 4: From (4) and Step 3: Sarah should receive stock options
Step 5: From (5): Sarah did receive stock options ✓
Conclusion: Scenario is consistent
```

### **Conditional Logic Chains**

#### **Modus Ponens Chain:**

```
If P then Q
If Q then R
If R then S
P is true
Therefore: S is true

Example:
If code is buggy → tests fail
If tests fail → build breaks
If build breaks → deployment stops
Code is buggy
Therefore: Deployment stops
```

#### **Modus Tollens Chain:**

```
If P then Q
If Q then R
R is false
Therefore: P is false

Example:
If good UX → users happy
If users happy → high ratings
High ratings is false (we have low ratings)
Therefore: We don't have good UX
```

### **Complex Logical Puzzles**

#### **The Missing Server Problem:**

```
Scenario:
Company has 3 servers: Alpha, Beta, Gamma
One server is definitely offline
System logs show conflicting information

Clues:
1. If Alpha offline → Beta shows error messages
2. If Beta offline → Gamma shows error messages
3. If Gamma offline → Alpha shows error messages
4. Exactly one server shows error messages
5. Beta is showing error messages

Question: Which server is offline?

Multi-Step Solution:
Step 1: From clue 5: Beta shows error messages
Step 2: From clue 4: Only Beta shows errors (no other server)
Step 3: From clue 1: If Alpha offline → Beta shows errors ✓
Step 4: From clue 2: If Beta offline → Gamma shows errors (but Gamma doesn't show errors)
Step 5: From clue 3: If Gamma offline → Alpha shows errors (but Alpha doesn't show errors)
Step 6: From steps 4&5: Beta and Gamma are NOT offline
Conclusion: Alpha is offline
```

## 🎭 **TRUTH-TELLER VS LIAR PUZZLES**

### **Basic Rules Review**

- **Truth-tellers**: Always tell the truth
- **Liars**: Always lie
- **Normal people**: Can tell truth or lie (in advanced puzzles)

### **Two-Person Puzzles**

#### **Classic Example:**

```
You meet two people: A and B
A says: "B is a liar"
B says: "A is a liar"

Analysis:
Case 1: A is truth-teller
→ B is liar (A's statement is true)
→ B says "A is liar" (this is a lie) ✓

Case 2: A is liar
→ B is not liar (A lies, so opposite is true)
→ B is truth-teller
→ B says "A is liar" (this is true) ✓

Conclusion: Both cases are consistent!
This is a classic paradox - we can't determine who's who.
```

### **Three-Person Puzzles (Multi-Step)**

#### **Advanced Truth-Teller Problem:**

```
You meet three people: X, Y, Z
X says: "Y and Z are both liars"
Y says: "X is a truth-teller and Z is a liar"
Z says: "X is a liar"

Multi-Step Analysis:

Step 1: Assume X is truth-teller
→ Y and Z are both liars (from X's statement)
→ Y says "X is truth-teller and Z is liar"
→ But Y is liar, so this statement is false
→ So either "X is not truth-teller" OR "Z is not liar"
→ But we assumed X is truth-teller, so Z must not be liar
→ Contradiction! (We said Z is liar from X's statement)

Step 2: Assume X is liar
→ X's statement "Y and Z are both liars" is false
→ So at least one of Y or Z is truth-teller
→ Z says "X is liar" (this should be true if Z is truth-teller)
→ Y says "X is truth-teller and Z is liar"
→ Since X is liar, first part is false, so whole statement is false
→ So Y is liar
→ Therefore Z must be truth-teller (since at least one of Y,Z is truth-teller)

Verification:
X = Liar, Y = Liar, Z = Truth-teller
- X says "Y and Z both liars" → False (Z is truth-teller) ✓
- Y says "X truth-teller and Z liar" → False ✓
- Z says "X is liar" → True ✓

Answer: X = Liar, Y = Liar, Z = Truth-teller
```

### **Grid Logic with Truth-Tellers**

#### **The Job Assignment Puzzle:**

```
Four people: Ana, Budi, Citra, Deni
Jobs: Doctor, Teacher, Engineer, Chef
Each person makes one statement:

Ana: "Budi is not the doctor"
Budi: "Citra is the teacher"
Citra: "I am not the engineer"
Deni: "Ana is the chef"

Additional info: Exactly one person is lying

Multi-Step Solution:

Step 1: Assume Ana is lying
→ Ana's statement "Budi is not doctor" is false
→ So Budi IS the doctor
→ All other statements are true:
   - Budi: "Citra is teacher" → True
   - Citra: "I am not engineer" → True (she's teacher)
   - Deni: "Ana is chef" → True
→ Jobs: Ana=Chef, Budi=Doctor, Citra=Teacher, Deni=Engineer
→ Check: All constraints satisfied ✓

Step 2: Assume Budi is lying
→ Budi's statement "Citra is teacher" is false
→ Citra is NOT teacher
→ All other statements true:
   - Ana: "Budi not doctor" → True
   - Citra: "I not engineer" → True
   - Deni: "Ana is chef" → True
→ So far: Ana=Chef, Citra≠Teacher&≠Engineer, so Citra=Doctor
→ But Ana said Budi not doctor, and Citra is doctor, so Budi≠Doctor
→ Remaining: Budi=Teacher or Engineer, Deni=Teacher or Engineer
→ This works, let's say Budi=Engineer, Deni=Teacher

Continue checking other cases...

Answer: Multiple solutions possible, need more constraints.
```

## 🔗 **CAUSAL ANALYSIS & CHAIN REASONING**

### **Advanced Mill's Methods**

#### **Method of Residues:**

```
If phenomenon ABCD occurs in situation WXYZ,
and we know:
- A causes W
- B causes X
- C causes Y
Then: D probably causes Z

Example:
Website performance issues (slow, crashes, errors, timeouts)
Recent changes (new code, server upgrade, database migration, CDN change)
Known relationships:
- New code → slow performance ✓
- Server upgrade → better performance (not crashes)
- Database migration → some errors ✓
Residue: CDN change → timeouts (most likely)
```

#### **Method of Agreement + Difference Combined:**

```
Look for factors that are:
1. Present when effect occurs (Agreement)
2. Absent when effect doesn't occur (Difference)

Example: App Crash Analysis
Crash occurs:
- Monday 2PM: High CPU, Low memory, User=John, Action=Upload
- Tuesday 3PM: Normal CPU, Low memory, User=Sarah, Action=Upload
- Wednesday 1PM: High CPU, Low memory, User=Mike, Action=Browse

No crash:
- Monday 4PM: High CPU, Normal memory, User=John, Action=Browse
- Tuesday 5PM: Normal CPU, Normal memory, User=Sarah, Action=Browse

Common factor in crashes: Low memory + Upload action
Probable cause: Memory leak during upload process
```

### **Causal Chain Analysis**

#### **The 5 Why's Method (Enhanced):**

```
Problem: Customer complaints increased 300%

Why 1: Why did complaints increase?
→ Response time to tickets went from 2 hours to 8 hours

Why 2: Why did response time increase?
→ Support team is overwhelmed with tickets

Why 3: Why is team overwhelmed?
→ Ticket volume doubled, but team size same

Why 4: Why did ticket volume double?
→ New product feature launched with poor documentation

Why 5: Why was documentation poor?
→ Feature rushed to market without proper QA process

Root Cause: Inadequate QA process for documentation
Solution: Implement documentation review in QA pipeline
```

#### **Fishbone + Multi-Step Analysis:**

```
Problem: E-commerce checkout abandonment rate 40%

Categories → Sub-causes → Root analysis:

Technical Issues:
- Page load slow → Database queries unoptimized → No caching strategy
- Payment errors → Third-party API issues → No fallback payment method

User Experience:
- Too many steps → Complex checkout flow → No user testing done
- Unclear pricing → Hidden fees → Pricing not transparent upfront

Business Process:
- Inventory issues → Overselling products → Real-time inventory not synced
- Shipping costs → High shipping fees → No free shipping threshold

Multi-step solution:
1. Immediate: Implement caching (technical fix)
2. Short-term: Add payment fallbacks, simplify checkout
3. Long-term: Redesign pricing strategy, improve inventory system
```

## 🔢 **PATTERN RECOGNITION IN LOGIC**

### **Logical Sequence Patterns**

#### **Truth Value Patterns:**

```
Sequence: T, F, T, F, F, T, F, F, F, T, ?

Analysis:
- Single T, single F
- Single T, double F
- Single T, triple F
Pattern: Single T followed by increasing F's
Next: Single T, quadruple F → so next value is F

Answer: F (part of the quadruple F sequence)
```

#### **Statement Validity Patterns:**

```
Evaluate these statements:
1. "All cats are animals" - Valid
2. "Some animals are cats" - Valid
3. "All animals are cats" - Invalid
4. "Some cats are not animals" - Invalid
5. "No cats are animals" - Invalid

Pattern recognition:
- Universal positive about subset → Valid
- Particular positive about subset → Valid
- Universal positive about superset → Invalid
- Particular negative about subset → Invalid
- Universal negative about subset → Invalid

Rule: Statements about subsets being part of supersets are valid,
reverse statements are generally invalid.
```

### **Algorithmic Thinking Patterns**

#### **If-Then Decision Trees:**

```
Problem: User login system logic

Input: Username, Password
Decision tree:

If username exists:
    If password correct:
        If account active:
            → Grant access
        Else:
            → Show "Account suspended"
    Else:
        If attempts < 3:
            → Show "Wrong password"
        Else:
            → Lock account
Else:
    → Show "Username not found"

Pattern: Nested conditional logic with multiple decision points
Each level narrows down the possibilities
```

#### **Loop Logic Patterns:**

```
Analyzing iterative processes:

While condition X:
    Do action Y
    Update condition variables
    Check termination condition

Example: Binary search pattern
While (low <= high):
    mid = (low + high) / 2
    If target == array[mid]: return mid
    If target < array[mid]: high = mid - 1
    Else: low = mid + 1

Pattern recognition:
- Problem space halved each iteration
- Two variables (low, high) converge
- Termination when they cross
```

## 🧠 **INTEGRATION: MATH + LOGIC**

### **Numerical Logic Puzzles**

#### **The Age Problem:**

```
Three friends: Alice, Bob, Carol
Clues:
1. Sum of their ages = 72
2. Alice is twice as old as Bob was 3 years ago
3. Carol is 3 years older than Alice
4. Bob's age is prime number
5. All ages are integers

Multi-step solution:
Let Bob's current age = B, Alice = A, Carol = C

From clue 1: A + B + C = 72
From clue 3: C = A + 3
From clue 2: A = 2(B - 3) = 2B - 6

Substitute into clue 1:
(2B - 6) + B + (2B - 6 + 3) = 72
2B - 6 + B + 2B - 3 = 72
5B - 9 = 72
5B = 81
B = 16.2

But B must be integer and prime! Re-check...

Let me reconsider clue 2: "Alice is twice as old as Bob was 3 years ago"
So: A = 2 × (B - 3)

Try B = 17 (prime):
A = 2 × (17 - 3) = 2 × 14 = 28
C = A + 3 = 28 + 3 = 31
Check: 28 + 17 + 31 = 76 ≠ 72

Try B = 13 (prime):
A = 2 × (13 - 3) = 2 × 10 = 20
C = 20 + 3 = 23
Check: 20 + 13 + 23 = 56 ≠ 72

Try B = 19 (prime):
A = 2 × (19 - 3) = 2 × 16 = 32
C = 32 + 3 = 35
Check: 32 + 19 + 35 = 86 ≠ 72

Hmm, let me re-examine the constraints...
[Continue systematic checking]

Answer: Need to verify all prime possibilities systematically
```

### **Logic + Probability**

#### **The Monty Hall with Logic:**

```
Modified Monty Hall Problem:
- 3 doors: one has prize, two have goats
- You pick door 1
- Host (who knows what's behind doors) opens door 3, shows goat
- Host says: "Door 2 has either the prize or a goat. I always tell the truth about odds."
- Host offers you a switch to door 2

Logical analysis:
Step 1: Initially, P(Door 1 has prize) = 1/3
Step 2: Host opened door 3, showed goat
Step 3: Now only doors 1 and 2 remain
Step 4: P(Door 1 has prize) still = 1/3 (your initial choice unchanged)
Step 5: P(Door 2 has prize) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3

Logic: Switching doubles your probability of winning
Mathematical reasoning combined with logical deduction

- Server C: Processes 3n+1 requests on day n

Logical constraints:
- If any server processes >50 requests/day → system overloaded
- If system overloaded → response time >3 seconds
- If response time >3 seconds → user complaints increase
- Current response time is 1.5 seconds

Question: On which day will user complaints first start increasing?

## 📋 **JAWABAN LATIHAN**

### **Exercise 3.1: Multi-Step Deduction**

```
Step-by-step analysis:
1. Application crashed exactly 4 hours after startup
2. From rule 1: Memory leak occurred (since crash happened after 4 hours)
3. From rule 2: Database connection not closed (since memory leak occurred)
4. From rule 3: Large file upload might cause connection not to close
5. Large file was uploaded 30 minutes after startup
6. Timeline: Upload (30 min) → Connection not closed → Memory leak → Crash (4 hours)

Conclusion: Large file upload most likely caused the crash by preventing proper database connection closure, leading to memory leak.

Confidence: High (all logical steps connect cleanly)
```

### **Exercise 3.2: Truth-Teller Challenge**

```
Systematic analysis:

Assume Alex is lying:
- Alex: "Betty wrote buggy code" → False, so Betty didn't write it
- Diana: "Alex is lying" → True (consistent)
- Betty: "Charlie didn't write it" → Must be true (Betty not lying)
- Charlie: "Either Alex or Diana wrote it" → Must be true
- From Betty's statement: Charlie didn't write it
- From Alex being false: Betty didn't write it
- From Charlie's statement: Alex or Diana wrote it
- Since Alex didn't write it (Charlie's statement would be false if Alex wrote it while lying), Diana must have written it

Verification: Diana wrote buggy code, Alex is lying
- Alex: "Betty wrote it" → False ✓ (Alex lies)
- Betty: "Charlie didn't write it" → True ✓
- Charlie: "Alex or Diana wrote it" → True ✓ (Diana wrote it)
- Diana: "Alex is lying" → True ✓

Answer: Diana wrote the buggy code, Alex is lying
```

### **Exercise 3.3: Causal Chain Analysis**

```
Primary cause analysis:

Immediate correlation: Competitor product launch (Wednesday Week 1) coincides with sustained traffic drop

Contributing factors:
1. Site downtime (Thursday Week 1) - temporary but damaged reputation
2. Negative review (Friday Week 1) - amplified the problem
3. Competitor ad campaign (Week 2) - sustained the impact

Causal chain:
Competitor launch → User attention diverted → Our downtime at critical time → Negative review → Amplified perception problem → Competitor ads → Sustained traffic loss

Root cause: Competitor product launch
Critical failure: Our downtime during vulnerable period
Amplifier: Negative review timing

Conclusion: Primary cause is competitive pressure, but our own downtime turned temporary loss into sustained problem.
```

### **Exercise 3.4: Pattern Recognition Logic**

```
Pattern analysis:
Day 1: "All bugs fixed" - T → "Some bugs remain" would be F ✓
Day 2: "Some bugs remain" - F → "All bugs fixed" would be T ✗ (but statement shows F)
Day 3: "All bugs fixed" - F → "Some bugs remain" would be T ✓
Day 4: "Some bugs remain" - T → "All bugs fixed" would be F ✓
Day 5: "All bugs fixed" - F → "Some bugs remain" would be T ✓
Day 6: "Some bugs remain" - T → "All bugs fixed" would be F ✓

Pattern: Starting Day 3, the statements follow logical negation pattern
- Odd days: "All bugs fixed" - F
- Even days: "Some bugs remain" - T

Day 7 (odd): "All bugs fixed" should be F

Underlying pattern: After Day 2, reality is "some bugs always remain"
```

### **Exercise 3.5: Integration Challenge**

```
Mathematical analysis:
Server A: 2^n requests on day n
Server B: n² requests on day n
Server C: 3n+1 requests on day n

Day 1: A=2¹=2, B=1²=1, C=3(1)+1=4 → Total=7
Day 2: A=2²=4, B=2²=4, C=3(2)+1=7 → Total=15
Day 3: A=2³=8, B=3²=9, C=3(3)+1=10 → Total=27
Day 4: A=2⁴=16, B=4²=16, C=3(4)+1=13 → Total=45
Day 5: A=2⁵=32, B=5²=25, C=3(5)+1=16 → Total=73

Logical reasoning:
Day 4: Total=45 < 50 → Not overloaded
Day 5: Total=73 > 50 → System overloaded
If overloaded → Response time >3 seconds → User complaints increase

Answer: Day 5 will be the first day user complaints increase
```
